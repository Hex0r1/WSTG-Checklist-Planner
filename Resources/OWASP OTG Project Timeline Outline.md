This outline assumes a medium-complexity web security testing project based on the provided CSV data. I've structured the timeline around the main categories as sequential phases (though in practice, some could overlap, such as information gathering with configuration testing). Each phase's duration is derived from the summed medium-complexity hours for its tests.

Key assumptions:
- Project starts on Monday, September 29, 2025 (the next business day after the current date).
- One tester working 8 hours per business day (Monday to Friday), no holidays considered.
- Durations are calculated as ceiling of (hours / 8) business days per phase to account for partial days.
- Phases run sequentially with no overlap or dependencies beyond completion of the prior phase.
- Total estimated effort: 291 hours (sum of all medium-complexity tests; note that the CSV footer lists 220 hours, which may exclude optional tests marked with "*"â€”adjust the timeline if excluding those).

The Gantt chart basics are represented in the table below, showing each phase as a "bar" with start and end dates. In a visual Gantt chart (e.g., in tools like Microsoft Project or Excel), these would be horizontal bars on a calendar timeline, with bars stacked sequentially.

### Additional Notes
- **Overall Project Duration**: Approximately 8-9 weeks, ending on November 25, 2025.
- **Milestones**: Add buffer time for reporting (e.g., 5-10 days after API Testing) and client reviews. Key milestones could include completion of reconnaissance (end of Information Gathering) and vulnerability identification (end of Input Validation Testing, the longest phase).
- **Dependencies and Risks**: Phases like Input Validation depend on earlier mapping from Information Gathering. Risks include scope creep if the app's complexity exceeds medium (e.g., scaling up to high hours) or if optional "*" tests (e.g., ML tampering, GraphQL) are included, adding time.
- **Adjustments**: If excluding optional "*" tests, reduce hours accordingly (total ~223 hours), shortening the timeline by about 1-2 weeks. For parallel testing (e.g., Client-Side and API overlapping), the end date could shift earlier. If needed, I can refine based on specific exclusions or team size.
