based on the stable release as of September 28, 2025, WSTG V5.0 contains approximately 129 test cases across 12 main categories, including new sections like **API Testing** and expanded tests for modern threats (e.g., GraphQL, deserialization, cloud). These estimates assume a single pentester(mid-level) using standard tools (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nmap) and sequential testing. Times exclude reporting, setup, or client coordination (add 20-40 hours for these).
### Complexity Level Definitions

- **Low Complexity**: Small, simple application (e.g., static site, few pages, minimal auth, no APIs or database). Some tests (e.g., SQL injection, API-specific) may be skipped if irrelevant.
- **Medium Complexity**: Typical web app (e.g., multi-user, forms, database, APIs, moderate endpoints/features). Matches the prior estimate of 220 hours.
- **High Complexity**: Large, enterprise-level app (e.g., complex workflows, 1000+ endpoints, microservices, cloud integrations, AI/ML components). Assumes deeper testing and vulnerability chaining.
### Assumptions

- Estimates are for active testing; findings requiring exploitation may add time (e.g., +10-20% for confirmed SQLi).
- Automation (e.g., ZAP for XSS, sqlmap for SQLi) reduces repetitive tasks, but manual verification is included.
- Tests absent in the app (e.g., NoSQL injection without NoSQL) take zero time but are estimated for completeness.
- New v5 tests (e.g., API, WebAssembly) are based on v4 analogs with adjustments for complexity (e.g., APIs scale with endpoints).
- Low complexity ≈ 50% of Medium; High ≈ 2x Medium, reflecting scope differences.
- Tools and skills: Mid-level pentester with proficiency in Burp Suite, ZAP, Nmap, and manual techniques.



### Notes

- **Total Time**:
    - **Low**: ~110 hours (~2-3 weeks full-time). Skips tests like NoSQL, GraphQL, or APIs if absent.
    - **Medium**: ~220 hours (~4-6 weeks). Typical web app with APIs, auth, database.
    - **High**: ~440 hours (~8-12 weeks). Enterprise app with extensive endpoints, cloud, AI/ML.
- **Comparison to v4**: v5 adds ~28 tests (e.g., API Testing, 15 tests), increasing time by ~30% (171 vs. 220 hours for Medium). Deprecated tests (e.g., Flash) save ~5 hours; API section adds ~53 hours.
- **Efficiency**: Automation (ZAP, sqlmap, Postman) cuts 20-30% time. Prioritize high-risk tests (e.g., INPV-05 SQLi, AUTHZ-02 Bypass). Team testing reduces calendar time.
- **Variability**: Confirmed vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS) may add 2-4 hours/test. Skipped tests reduce time for Low complexity.






### OWASP WSTG V4.0 and V5.0 Comparison

The OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG), often referred to as the OTG (OWASP Testing Guide) checklist, is a comprehensive framework for web application penetration testing. It outlines controls, test scenarios, and methodologies to identify security weaknesses.
- **Version 4 (v4)**: The latest stable release is v4.2 (December 3, 2020). It builds on v4.1 (April 2020) with new testing scenarios, updated chapters, improved writing style, and better layout. The checklist uses the format OTG-<CATEGORY>-<NUMBER> (e.g., OTG-INFO-001) and is structured into 11 main categories under "Web Application Security Testing" (sections 4.2–4.12). It focuses on traditional web app risks, with some coverage of emerging threats like API testing.
-**Version 5 (v5)** : As of September 28, 2025, v5.0 is still in active development and not yet released as a stable version. The draft content is available on GitHub[](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg/tree/master/document) and the "latest" preview on the OWASP site[](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/). Development began around 2019 (with early drafts), and updates have included plans for modern threats like JWT/OAuth, expanded API and cloud testing, and alignment with OWASP Top 10 2021. The identifier format has evolved to WSTG-<version>-<CATEGORY>-<NUMBER> (e.g., WSTG-v5-INFO-01) for better versioning. The structure remains similar but with refinements, new sub-scenarios, and deprecated outdated ones (e.g., legacy Flash-related tests).

Key differences stem from v4's maturity as a stable guide versus v5's ongoing evolution to address post-2020 threats (e.g., supply chain attacks, serverless architectures). v5 aims to be more modular, with enhanced automation guidance and integration with DevSecOps.

### Structural Comparison

Both versions follow a phased testing methodology (Information Gathering → Configuration → Identity → Authentication → etc.), but v5 introduces more granular sub-tests, removes obsolete ones, and adds categories/subsections for modern contexts like APIs and client-side frameworks. Below is a side-by-side comparison of the main categories and key test counts. (Note: v5 counts are based on the current development draft; they may change before stable release.)

- **Total Tests**: v4.2 ≈ 101; v5 Draft ≈ 129 (includes expansions and new sections).
- **Overall Changes**: v5 shifts from web-centric to ecosystem-wide (e.g., APIs, cloud, DevOps). It incorporates OWASP Top 10 2021 (e.g., more on A01:2021-Broken Access Control) and removes legacy items (e.g., SSI injection if irrelevant). Writing is more concise, with better tool recommendations (e.g., integrating SAST/DAST).

### Key Enhancements in v5 (Based on Development Notes)

- **Modern Threats**: Expanded coverage for APIs (15+ new tests), serverless (e.g., Lambda misconfigs), and supply chain vulnerabilities.
- **Automation & Integration**: More guidance on CI/CD testing, automated scanners (e.g., ZAP, Burp), and metrics for test effectiveness.
- **Deprecated/Updated**: Removes outdated tests (e.g., Cross-Site Flashing for Flash); updates crypto to TLS 1.3+ and post-quantum readiness.
- **Format & Usability**: Versioned IDs prevent breakage; modular structure for easier updates. Includes contributor guidelines for community input.
- **No Major Overhaul**: Core phases remain intact for backward compatibility, but v5 is ~20-30% larger with refined remediation advice.

### Recommendations
- Use **v4.2** for stable, production pentesting—it's comprehensive and battle-tested.
- Preview **v5 draft** for forward-looking assessments, especially API-heavy apps. Monitor the GitHub repo for stable release (expected late 2025 or early 2026).
