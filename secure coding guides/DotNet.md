- **CERT Secure Coding Standards** - Guidelines for C# and .NET, emphasizing minimization of security breaches through practices like proper exception handling and secure resource management.

## Frameworks

Frameworks offer structured approaches or tools for integrating security into .NET development.

- **Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)** - A DevSecOps process with 10 security practices integrated into development phases (e.g., design, implementation, verification). Applies to .NET by incorporating threat modeling in ASP.NET Core projects and automated security scans in CI/CD pipelines.
- **.NET Built-in Security Features** - Includes ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication and authorization, Data Protection API for encrypting sensitive data, and middleware for CSRF protection. In .NET 9, enhancements include improved cryptographic defaults and integration with tools like Serilog for logging.
- **OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) for .NET** - Provides validators, encoders, and cryptography tools to standardize secure coding in .NET applications.

## Coding Examples: Secure .NET Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet-style guide highlights common vulnerabilities from OWASP Top 10, with brief descriptions, vulnerable code examples, and secure mitigations using .NET best practices. Examples are in C# for ASP.NET Core or general .NET, compliant with .NET 9. Focus on practical scenarios like web APIs or data access.

| Vulnerability | Description | Vulnerable Code Example | Secure Code Example & Mitigation |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **A01: Broken Access Control** | Allows unauthorized access to resources. Common in .NET via missing authorization checks. | ```csharp
| **A02: Cryptographic Failures** | Weak encryption exposes sensitive data. In .NET, avoid outdated algorithms like MD5. | ```csharp<br>var hash = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider().ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password));<br>``` | Use strong hashing: ```csharp<br>var hash = PasswordHasher.HashPassword(password); // Using ASP.NET Identity<br>``` Mitigation: Leverage .NET's System.Security.Cryptography for AES-GCM and secure key management. |
| **A03: Injection** | Unsanitized input leads to attacks like SQL injection. | ```csharp<br>string query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = '" + userInput + "'";<br>var result = connection.Execute(query);<br>``` | Parameterize queries: ```csharp<br>var result = _db.Users.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = {0}", userInput).ToList();<br>``` Mitigation: Use Entity Framework Core's parameterized methods to bind inputs safely. |
| **A04: Insecure Design** | Design flaws like missing threat modeling. | N/A (design-level) | Incorporate SDL practices: Perform threat modeling during design phase using tools like Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool. Mitigation: Use secure patterns like dependency injection for isolated components. |
| **A05: Security Misconfiguration** | Exposed defaults or debug modes. | ```csharp<br>// web.config<br><customErrors mode="Off" /><br>``` | Secure config: ```csharp<br>// Program.cs (ASP.NET Core)<br>if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");<br>``` Mitigation: Disable tracing and use production configs via transforms. |
| **A06: Vulnerable Components** | Outdated NuGet packages with known issues. | N/A (dependency-level) | Regularly scan: Use `dotnet list package --vulnerable` and update via NuGet. Mitigation: Integrate tools like Dependabot in CI/CD. |
| **A07: Authentication Failures** | Weak sessions or brute-force exposure. | ```csharp<br>// Simple login without throttling<br>if (password == storedPassword) // Plain text<br>``` | Secure auth: ```csharp<br>// Use Identity<br>var result = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(userName, password, false, lockoutOnFailure: true);<br>``` Mitigation: Enable lockouts and use short session timeouts (e.g., 60 minutes). |
| **A08: Integrity Failures** | Insecure deserialization or unverified updates. | ```csharp<br>var obj = BinaryFormatter.Deserialize(stream); // Deprecated<br>``` | Safe alternative: ```csharp<br>var obj = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>(json); // With validation<br>``` Mitigation: Avoid BinaryFormatter; use Json.NET with type restrictions. |
| **A09: Logging Failures** | Inadequate monitoring hinders detection. | ```csharp<br>Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);<br>``` | Structured logging: ```csharp<br>_logger.LogError(ex, "Error processing request"); // Using ILogger<br>``` Mitigation: Integrate Serilog or NLog for detailed, searchable logs. |
| **A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** | Unvalidated external requests. | ```csharp<br>var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(userUrl);<br>``` | Validate URLs: ```csharp<br>if (!IsSafeUrl(userUrl)) return BadRequest();<br>var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(userUrl);<br>``` Mitigation: Whitelist domains and use HttpClient with restrictions. |
