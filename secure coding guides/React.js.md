# Secure React.js Programming: Resources, Standards, Frameworks, and Coding Examples

this guide provides a comprehensive overview of secure React.js programming. It draws from established best practices to help developers at all levels build resilient applications. The focus is on current standards as of September 2025, emphasizing React 19 features where applicable, such as improved state management and hooks for secure data handling, while avoiding outdated practices like direct DOM manipulation without safeguards or insecure third-party libraries.

## Standards

Standards provide formalized rules to defend against common threats. These are essential for aligning React.js development with industry best practices.

- **OWASP Top 10 (2021 Edition, with 2025 Updates Anticipated)** - Identifies critical risks like Broken Access Control, Cryptographic Failures, and Injection. In React, mitigate Injection via JSX escaping, and Broken Access Control with role-based checks in components. The next edition is expected in November 2025.
- **OWASP Principles for Secure React Applications** - Covers input validation, authentication, error handling, secure configuration, access control, and data handling tailored to React.
- **General Recommendations for React Secure Coding (WSO2 Security Docs)** - Recommends using react-markdown for Markdown protection, sanitizing inputs, and avoiding insecure DOM manipulations.
- **CERT Secure Coding Standards for JavaScript** - Guidelines for secure JS code, applicable to React, focusing on exception handling and resource management to minimize breaches.

## Frameworks

Frameworks and tools offer structured approaches for integrating security into React.js development.

- **Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)** - A DevSecOps process with practices like threat modeling and security scans, applicable to React projects via CI/CD integration for vulnerability checks.
- **React Built-in Features** - JSX for auto-escaping, hooks for secure state (e.g., useState, useContext), and React Router for protected routes. In React 19, enhancements include better async handling for secure data fetching.
- **OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) for JavaScript** - Provides validators, encoders, and tools for standardizing secure coding in React apps.
- **Supporting Libraries and Tools** - DOMPurify for HTML sanitization, Helmet (via react-helmet) for CSP headers, npm audit for dependency scanning, and Auth0 or JWT libraries for authentication.

## Coding Examples: Secure React.js Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet-style guide highlights common vulnerabilities from OWASP Top 10, with brief descriptions, vulnerable code examples, and secure mitigations using React.js best practices. Examples are in JavaScript for React 19-compatible apps, focusing on practical scenarios like component rendering and data handling.

| Vulnerability | Description | Vulnerable Code Example | Secure Code Example & Mitigation |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **A01: Broken Access Control** | Unauthorized access to components or data, common in React via missing role checks. | ```jsx
| **A02: Cryptographic Failures** | Weak encryption exposes data; in React, avoid storing sensitive info in localStorage without encryption. | ```jsx<br>localStorage.setItem('token', plainToken);<br>``` | Use secure storage: ```jsx<br>import Cookies from 'js-cookie';<br>Cookies.set('token', encryptedToken, { secure: true, sameSite: 'strict' });<br>``` Mitigation: Use HTTPS and libraries like crypto-js for encryption; avoid client-side storage for secrets. |
| **A03: Injection (XSS)** | Unsanitized input leads to script execution, e.g., via dangerouslySetInnerHTML. | ```jsx<br>function Component({ html }) {<br>  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />;<br>}<br>``` | Sanitize input: ```jsx<br>import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';<br>function Component({ html }) {<br>  const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(html);<br>  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: clean }} />;<br>}<br>``` Mitigation: Leverage JSX escaping; use DOMPurify for dynamic HTML. |
| **A04: Insecure Design** | Design flaws like missing validation in forms. | N/A (design-level) | Incorporate SDL: Use threat modeling; validate forms with libraries like Yup in React forms. Mitigation: Apply least privilege in component props. |
| **A05: Security Misconfiguration** | Exposed defaults, e.g., debug mode in production. | ```jsx<br>// package.json<br>"homepage": "http://example.com"<br>``` | Secure config: ```jsx<br>// Use HTTPS in production<br>if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') { /* HTTPS enforcement */ }<br>``` Mitigation: Update dependencies with npm audit; configure CSP via react-helmet. |
| **A06: Vulnerable Components** | Outdated packages with known vulnerabilities. | N/A (dependency-level) | Scan regularly: Use `npm audit` and update via npm. Mitigation: Integrate Snyk or Dependabot in CI/CD. |
| **A07: Authentication Failures** | Weak sessions or exposed tokens. | ```jsx<br>// Plain storage<br>localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));<br>``` | Secure auth: ```jsx<br>import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';<br>const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();<br>// Use secure JWT with lockouts<br>``` Mitigation: Use Auth0 or JWT with expiration and secure cookies. |
| **A08: Integrity Failures** | Insecure deserialization or unverified data. | ```jsx<br>// Unsafe URL<br><a href={userUrl}>Link</a><br>``` | Validate: ```jsx<br>function validateURL(url) {<br>  const parsed = new URL(url);<br>  return ['https:', 'http:'].includes(parsed.protocol);<br>}<br><a href={validateURL(url) ? url : ''}>Link</a><br>``` Mitigation: Use allowlists for URLs; avoid unsafe props. |
| **A09: Logging Failures** | Inadequate monitoring exposes issues. | ```jsx<br>console.log(error);<br>``` | Structured logging: ```jsx<br>import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';<br>Sentry.captureException(error);<br>``` Mitigation: Use Sentry for secure, centralized logging without sensitive data. |
| **A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** | Unvalidated requests from client-side. | ```jsx<br>fetch(userUrl);<br>``` | Validate: ```jsx<br>if (!isSafeUrl(userUrl)) return;<br>fetch(userUrl);<br>``` Mitigation: Whitelist domains in fetch options; use CORS properly. |
